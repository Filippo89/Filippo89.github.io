      <h1><a name="Biography AA" class="anchor" ></a> Alvar Aalto </h1>

      <p> Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer.<br>

      <center><img src="https://raw.github.com/Filippo89/Filippo89.github.io/master/images/AA.jpg" title="Alvar Aalto"></center>
      <center><small>Alvar Aalto photo</small></center>
    
      <br>
      His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art; whereby he would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture - like chairs, vases, lamps and so on. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyväskylä. </p>

      <h2> <a name="Career AA" class="anchor"></a> Career in art design </h2>

      <p>Like many other of the generation in the nordic country, Alvar Aalto started off from a classical education before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism. 
      During the first period of activity he completed his firsts public buildings. Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad. Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. 
      <br> In 1932 he achieved world attention in architecture; the "Finnish Pavillion" was defined by Frank Lloyd Wright as a "work of genius". In the same time he started to have join architecture with all-day life. Infact he designed the "Aalto glasees".

      From this inspiration about, in 1936 he designed the famouse <a href="#Savoy vase">savoy vase</a>.<br>
      His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to MIT, in the USA. This was during the Second World War, and he involved his students in designing low-cost, small-scale housing for the reconstruction of war-torn Finland. While teaching at MIT, Aalto also designed the student dormitory, Baker House, completed in 1948. This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period.<br><br>

      This was the period of high architecture activity. On his return to Finland, Aalto is used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), Säynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

      Since the fifties begins to get prestigious international awards, among which are the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1957 and an honorary degree conferred by Politecnico di Milano. In 1965 Aalto held a major exhibition in the Palazzo Strozzi in Firenze, which is celebrated as one of the best European artists of the century.<br>
      Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and Essen opera house. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.

    <h2> <a name="Design AA" class="anchor"></a> Design </h2>
    <p> <cite>"Building art is a synthesis of life in materialised form. We should try to bring in under the same hat not a splintered way of thinking, but all in harmony together." </cite><br><br>
      Alvar Aalto studied with Armas Lindgren, one of the leaders of the Finnish Romanticism. Early in his career Aalto seems to be, from the ideological point of view, a classicist.<br>
      From 1930's, after his rational period, the idea of ​​architecture has been extended to technical and psychological themes. This represented an evolution of Aalto's thinking about architecture e signed himself. The Aalto style is a constant reference to the tradition of his own country, Finland. The building and the furnitures were not an lonely structures in space but were parts of space around. All must be "armony".<br><br>
    <cite>"Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art."</cite><br><br>
    <cite>"We should concentrate our work not only to a separated housing problem but housing involved in our daily work and all the other functions of the city."</cite><br><br>
    His activity was really extensive and range from furnitures design and object in glass to architecture and painting. Also in  small objects, as a spoon, the work of Aalto was characterized by recurrent architectural detail: the sign of "wave" , which is called in Finnish "aalto" as his surname. 
    </p><br>

    <h1><a name="Project AA" class="anchor" ></a> Project </h1>
    <p> I chosen for my final project three of the Alvar Aalto furnitures. These represent the start of evolution about psychological inspiration of the author and define the importance of the "aalto wave", the most famous detail of Alvar Aalto in all over the worlds.</p><br>

    <h2> <a name="Savoy vase" class="anchor"></a> Savoy vase </h2>
    <p>
    In 1936 Alvar Aalto designed this his first furniture. This represent the starting line up of psychological evolution of Aalto's thinking and the born of his wave.<br><br>

    <center><small>Savoy Vase - 1936</small></center>
    <br>
    To model this furniture I first created the skeleton of the superior vase buorderlines with NUBS curve in Plasm.js module. The support functions <code>genNUBS</code> and <code>generatorKnot</code> in used to generate the NUBS curve simply with the knows of the control points.  <br>  
    <pre><code>var vasoup1 = genNUBS(points1); // curve=[0] nubs=[1]</code></pre>
    <pre><code>function genNUBS (controlPoints){
    var domain = INTERVALS(1)(32)
    var knots = generateKnot(controlPoints)
    var nubs = NUBS(S0)(2)(knots)(controlPoints)
    var curve = MAP(nubs)(domain)
    return [curve,nubs]
    }</code></pre>    
    <pre><code>function generateKnot(controlPoints){
    lun = controlPoints.length + 2 + 1;
    var nodeSeq = [];
    nodeSeq[0] = 0;
    nodeSeq[1] = 0;
    nodeSeq[2] = 0;
      for (i = 3; i <= lun - 4 ; i++) {
        nodeSeq[i] = i-2;
      };
    nodeSeq[lun-1] = i-2
    nodeSeq[lun-2] = i-2
    nodeSeq[lun-3] = i-2
      return nodeSeq
  } </code></pre>

    <center><small>Savoy Vase bourderlines in Plasm.js</small></center>
    <br>
    After the definition of the skeleton bourderlines I created the surfaces between them thanks to <code>bez_sup()</code> function that make a Bezier-mapping on S1 of the two bourderlines curves. Then I <code>EXTRUDE([2.5])</code> the just created surface to design the transparent body of the vase. At the end I generated the bottom vase with <code>bez_sup()</code> of the same control points used to generate the external bourderline.<br>
    So the complete model is the result of <code>savoy_vase()</code> function and the color of the vase is the two value array passed through the call to the function.

    <h2> <a name="Paimio chair" class="anchor"></a> Paimio chair </h2>
    <p>In 1936 Alvar Aalto continued to design furnitures with his idea of waves. The Paimio chair was designed as a part of the Paimio hospital in Finland.<br><br>

    <center><small> Paimio chair - 1936</small></center>
    <br>
    The following scheme of chair constituition was important for modelling. I concentrated first to the legs/structure of the chair, than I implemented the body. <br><br>
     <img src="https://raw.github.com/Filippo89/Filippo89.github.io/master/images/chair2.jpg" title="Structure">

    <center><small>Model compositing parts </small></center><br><br>    
    <br>
    The frame was implemented by using two Bezier support function. The first function, <code>bez_curve()</code> create a Bezier curve from control points in passing array; the second one support function, <code>bez_sup()</code>, create a surfaces between two or more curves passing in the array; I used these two functions to create a profile of legs. Then I make an <code>EXTRUDE([body_depth])</code> to complete the models of them. <br><br>

    <pre><code>var bez_curve = function(controlpoints){
      return BEZIER(S0)(controlpoints);}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>var bez_sup = function(curves){
      return MAP(BEZIER(S1)(curves))(dom2D);}</code></pre>
    
    The body was implemented with the same tecnique, using Bezier functions.<br><br>

    <h2> <a name="Tea trolley" class="anchor"></a> Tea Trolley </h2>
    <p> Introduced in 1936 at the Paris World's Fair, the charming Tea Trolley features Alvar Aalto's innovative side frames made of molded laminated birch, hand-made wicker basket and a tile top that is available in black or white. Aalto designed this cart for residential use. He placed it in the living room of the Villa Mairea (1937-1939). It is based on an earlier serving cart designed for the Paimio Sanitorium (1933).

    <br>
    The peculiary of this furnitures is the similarity of its structure with the paimio chair frames structure. For this reason I used the same supports function, <code>bez_curve</code> and <code>bez_sup</code>, to model the furniture structure in Plasm. <br>
    The implementation of the rest of trolley was possible thanks to other supports function. <br>
    The <code>steering()</code> function create the steering of the trolley using two bezier-circumferences:<br><br>
    <pre><code>var steering = function(r,h){
  var d1 = circle(r,0);
  var d2 = circle(r,h);
  var tubo = MAP(BEZIER(S1)([d1,d2]))(domain);
  var cop1 = DISK([r])([36,1]);
  return STRUCT([tubo, cop1, T([2])([h])(cop1)]);

};</code></pre>

  <center><small> Tea Trolley compositions</small></center>
  <br>

  The <a name="wheel" class="anchor"><code>wheel()</code></a> function create the trolley's wheels in specific colours (no passing array for coulors):
  <pre><code>var wheel = function(r,h,d,color){

  var d1 = COLOR(color)(DISK([r])([36,1]));
  var c1 = COLOR(color)(CYL_SURFACE([r,d])([36,1]));
  var c2 = COLOR([0,0,0])(T([2])([d])(CYL_SURFACE([r,h])([36,1]))); //black, ever
  var c3 = T([2])([h+d])(c1);
  var d2 = T([2])([h+2*d])(d1);
  return STRUCT([c1,c2,c3,d1,d2]);
};</code></pre>

  <center><small> Tea Trolley compositions</small></center>
  <br>


  At the end, the <code>grid()</code> function create a grid for the trolley's plates:
  <pre><code>var grid = function(maxx,maxz,axis,n){
  if (axis === 2){
    var p1 = POLYLINE([[0,0,0], [maxx,0,0]]);
    var griglia = REPLICA(n)([p1, T([axis])([maxz/(n-1)])]);
  } else if (axis === 0){
    var p1 = POLYLINE([[0,0,0], [0,0,maxz]]);
    var griglia = REPLICA(n)([p1, T([axis])([maxx/(n-1)])]);
  }

  return STRUCT(griglia);
};
</code></pre>

  The complete model is the result of <code>tea_trolley()</code> function; the structure color is the value array passed through the call to the function, while the wheels color is constant.

  <h2> <a name="Inspiration" class="anchor"></a> Inspiration </h2>
  <p> Some artists, architects and designers take as inspiration Alvar Aalto futuristic art. One of the most important example of this inspiration is the <a href='http://gamfratesi.com/'>GamFratesi</a> chariot work. Chariot is a side table composed of three simple elements: wheels, trays and structure.

  The wheels, which in common trolleys are usual of small dimension, are redimensioned and are becoming the central element of the project, giving the trolley an iconic and unique expression. A standard profile in silicone is insert in the wheel protecting and optimizing the movement. The curve on the upper part of the metal structure is working as handle, and lifting slightly by the handle the trolley is easy to move around.<br>

  The metal structure is implemented by using Cubic-Hermite mapping on S1. In particoular: <br><br>
  <pre><code>var herm_sup = function(curves){
  return MAP(CUBIC_HERMITE(S1)(curves))(dom2D);
};</code></pre>
  where <code>curves</code> is an array of both curves implements by <code>bez_curve()</code> and points that made cylindricial depth to surface in between. <br>

  The wheels are implemented by using the same <code>wheels()</code> function seen <a href="#wheel">before</a>. <br><br>
