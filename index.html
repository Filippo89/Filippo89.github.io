        <p> Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976)</p><br>

        <p><img src="https://raw.github.com/Filippo89/Filippo89.github.io/master/images/AA.jpg" title="Alvar Aalto"><br> was a Finnish architect and designer. 
       His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware. Aalto's early career runs in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the twentieth century and many of his clients were industrialists. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art; whereby he would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture - like chairs, vases, lamps and so on. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city Jyväskylä. </p>

       <h2> <a name="Career AA" class="anchor"></a> Career in art design </h2>

      <p>Like many other of the generation in the nordic country, Alvar Aalto started off from a classical education before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism. 
      During the first period of activity he completed his firsts public buildings. Aalto also entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad. Furthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. 
      <br> In 1932 he achieved world attention in architecture; the "Finnish Pavillion" was defined by Frank Lloyd Wright as a "work of genius". In the same time he started to have join architecture with all-day life. Infact he designed the "Aalto glasees".

      From this inspiration about, in 1936 design the "savoy vase". <bd>
      His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to MIT, in the USA. This was during the Second World War, and he involved his students in designing low-cost, small-scale housing for the reconstruction of war-torn Finland. While teaching at MIT, Aalto also designed the student dormitory, Baker House, completed in 1948. This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period.

      This was the period of high architecture activity. On his return to Finland, Aalto is used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), Säynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

      Since the fifties begins to get prestigious international awards, among which are the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1957 and an honorary degree conferred by Politecnico di Milano. In 1965 Aalto held a major exhibition in the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, which is celebrated as one of the best European artists of the century.<br>
      Following Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyväskylä City Theatre and Essen opera house. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.
